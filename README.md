# School_District_Analysis

Using the provided testing data for PyCity Schools, we were asked to perform various types of analysis using Pandas on a .csv file.

Output was to be filtered and formatted using a variety of methods such as loc and iloc, and various conditional statements. 

This was an interesting project, in that there were multiple ways to do many of the required operations. I found the practice of doing the operation with both loc and iloc to be very helpful in understanding their attributes. Additionally, the speed with which Pandas is able to slice lots of data is impressive. 

This exposure to Python and Pandas has opened a potential door for me. Building on this exposure I see how it is possible to use data gathered in the real world by inexpensive sensors to glean insights into vehicle dynamics. I look forward to discovering the many wonderful libraries there are to explore.
